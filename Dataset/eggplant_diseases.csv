Watering Technique: Use drip irrigation or furrow irrigation. Avoid overhead watering and overwatering to eliminate the free water necessary for zoospores to move.

Rotation (LONG): Implement a long crop rotation (4 years or more) with non-host crops to starve the pathogen's survival structures (oospores) in the soil.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy all infected plants and fruit immediately. Do not compost infected material.

Resistant Varieties: Select and plant resistant or tolerant cultivars as the primary method of control in areas with a history of the disease.

Hygiene: Avoid working in fields when they are wet to prevent the spread of the pathogen on tools, equipment, or shoes."

Watering Technique: Water plants primarily at the base using drip irrigation. If overhead watering is necessary, do it early in the morning to reduce night humidity.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy all infected leaves, stems, and plant debris immediately and thoroughly after the season ends to eliminate overwintering spores.

Plant Resistance: Choose and plant resistant or tolerant cultivars whenever available for your specific crop.
